1.  Requirements
     i.  Operating System - Linux
     ii. C Compiler
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

2. Files/Folders
  
There are two folders named cn_lab and cn_server_room. 
(1) cn_lab contains data recorded in the lab i.e non-traffic scenario where as 
    cn_server_room contains files corresponding to the real world traffic.

(2) Each folder has the following :
	i.  Folder - c files
	    It contains the c codes of all the algorithms implemented and their variations.

	ii.  Folder - matlab c files
	     It contains the .c files of the above mentioned codes modified in a way that
	     the output is generated in format which can be directly read in MATLAB. 

	iii.  Folder - data files
	     It contains the .data files which contains the output generated by the matlab 
	     c files that we used to create graphs in matlab.
	
	iv.  Folder - text files
	      This folder contains the .txt files which has the observations outputted by the 
	      .c files for the codes.

	v.   Folder - graphs
	     It contains all the graphs generated in MATLAB using .data files which
	     provides a graphical comparision between the algorithms for different 
	     parameters and variations.

	vi.  File - ping.txt
	     It is a text file containing the output generated by the ping command.

	vii. Folder - report
	     It contains latex files.

(3) cn_server_room also contains an additional file named routers.txt which has the output
    of the trace route command for the real world traffic.

3.  Usage
     All the files starting with "server_" are to be compiled on the server machine whereas the
     file client.c is to be run on client side.
 
        *********************************************************************
	 Before compiling, some changes are to be made in the server codes.
	 In the line, #define MY_IP "172.22.14.163", the server's IP address 
	 has to be entered in place of already specified IP address.
	*********************************************************************
     Machine's IP Address can be obtained by ifconfig command on the terminal.

     Compile:
	On Server -- gcc <filename>
	On client -- gcc <filename>

     Run:
	On Server -- ./a.out
	On Client -- ./a.out <server's IP Address>
